# Inventory-management-system
In my second year of university, I created an inventory management system for Woolworths as part of a group project. The system offers smooth checkout procedures, real-time stock updates, and product addition to aÂ cart. The system features an impressive and complicated relational database. Utilized technologies include ASP.NET and C#.
